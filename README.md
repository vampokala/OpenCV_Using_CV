## Prerequisites

To run the notebook, you need to have the following installed:

- Python (3.6 or higher recommended)
- Jupyter Notebook
- OpenCV (cv2)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

Ensure you have a working Python environment. You can use tools like [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution) to manage your packages and environment easily.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/vampokala/OpenCV_Using_CV.git
   cd OpenCV_Using_CV
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   You can install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Or install them individually:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy opencv-python matplotlib jupyter
   ```

3. **Run Jupyter Notebook**:
   Start the Jupyter notebook server and open the notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook OpenCV_for_Images.ipynb
   ```

### 1. Introduction to OpenCV

An overview of OpenCV, including its capabilities and common applications. For more information, visit the [OpenCV official documentation](https://docs.opencv.org/).

### 2. Reading and Displaying Images

This section covers how to read images from files and display them using OpenCV and Matplotlib.

### 3. Image Transformations

Learn how to perform basic image transformations such as scaling, rotation, and translation.

### 4. Drawing on Images

Techniques for drawing shapes and text on images, which can be useful for creating annotations or visualizing data.

### 5. Color Spaces

Understand how to convert images between different color spaces (e.g., BGR to Grayscale, HSV).

### 6. Image Thresholding

Explore thresholding techniques to segment images based on pixel intensity.

### 7. Contour Detection

Methods for detecting and drawing contours, which are essential for shape analysis and object detection.

### 8. Image Filtering

Apply various filters to images for smoothing, sharpening, and other effects.

### 9. Edge Detection

Use edge detection algorithms to highlight the edges within images.

## Usage

To run the notebook, open it in Jupyter and execute the cells step-by-step. Each section is self-contained and demonstrates specific image processing techniques using OpenCV. You can modify the code and parameters to experiment with different images and observe the results.
